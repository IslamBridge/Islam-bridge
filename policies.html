              These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use
              of the
              <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://islambridge.com">islambridge.com</a> website
              (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively,
              “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this
              Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on
              behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind
              such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to
              such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this
              agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and
              Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
              understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this
              Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not
              physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services. This terms and
              conditions policy was created with the help of the

              thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your
              conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account
              for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email
              address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.

              is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.
